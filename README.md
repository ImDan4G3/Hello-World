# Hello-World
I've yet to use my first programming language, although I am currently working towards attaining the 'cURL' language to utilize IBM's Text-to-Speech software application.
My signature trait to attaining computer scientist like skills might be persistence, the ability of myself to continue through adversity and never stop trying
persistence is key?
